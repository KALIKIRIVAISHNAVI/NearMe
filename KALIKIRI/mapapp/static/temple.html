    It is believed that the goddess Lakshmi was born as Alamelu to Akasha Raja, the ruler of this region, and wed Venkateswara of Tirupati. Lakshmi gave darshan to Venkateswara on a red Lotus flower (Padma in Sanskrit) at Alamelu mangapuram after his deep penance for twelve years. According to tradition, the goddess manifested herself in the holy Pushkarini called Padmasarovaram in a golden lotus. The Venkatachala Mahatyam states that the Sun-god Suryanarayana was instrumental in blossoming of the lotus in full splendour. A temple dedicated to Suryanarayana is situated on the eastern side of the Pushkarini.
